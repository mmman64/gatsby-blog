This blog came to be not long after my coding bootcamp experience at Flatiron School. The fact that I've claimed my small piece of the net to regularly post content, whether technical or otherwise, is testament to just how valuable and transformative the experience has been for me.

I wasn't new to coding at the time I applied, yet I anticipated an ROI that would extend beyond mere coding ability and I think I was right! The purpose of this post isn't to talk about my coding bootcamp experience, however, just to say hi (HELLO! üòÅ) and to outline my intentions for this blog.

In one sentence:

*"To serve as a living reference for things that I am learning and things I may have struggled with in the past, a playground for trying out some design ideas and exploring fun CSS tricks, and a brain dump for things that are interesting to me."*

I settled on a .tech domain after hearing about it on the <span style="color: #ff729f">[Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/)</span> podcast because it was super cheap and seemed more appropriate/fun than opting for the usual .com.

The site is built with Gatsby, which I learnt specifically for this purpose (mainly using Jason Lengstorf's comprehensive introduction on Frontend Masters). I've developed and deployed a professional Wordpress site before and it was definitely an experience I felt could be improved upon... a lot.

The JAMStack architecture offers a super easy, secure, cheap and performant solution. Write some React, some Markdown, a couple of GraphQL queries to grab your content, push it up to GitHub, set up a Netlify account, and voila!

Without getting into the nitty-gritty right now, this means that I can focus on the site design and content. When I push my changes to GitHub, this will trigger Netlify to run a fresh build, and my changes will be live in minutes. No databases to worry about, free hosting and even a free SSL certificate! Very very nice! üòâ

As for styling, I was completely new to styled-components and the concept of CSS-in-JS. Wow. I have to say I hated it at first and I'm still a little on the fence about it. I love having well-commented, ordered and separated CSS files, with good use of class names, ids, descendent selectors etc.

A well-written stylesheet is a joy to read through and work with. But hey, in good spirit I thought I'd completely embrace this new way of doing things as an experiment and see how I feel about it after a while. I went with Emotion CSS, for no reason other than it was what JL used in his workshop.

I can appreciate the benefits and I do think you can do some clever things this way, but I love well-structured, semantic HTML files as much as my tidy stylesheets, and at the moment I can't help but cringe a bit at how CRAZY my code looks with all this JSX and CSS everywhere.

Maybe that'll die down in time?

As far as features, I'm going to implement search functionality for posts (probably just new/old and tags) once I have a few more posts up and get comments going as I absolutely want to provide the facility for any readers to point out any mistakes, misconceptions, misunderstandings, or potential improvements etc. etc. etc.

That's about it I think, brain dump 00 done üöÄ
